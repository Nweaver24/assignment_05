Cell Phones in Society
Over the last decade, the use and production of cell phones has increased astronomically. So much so that it is almost impossible to live or work in today’s society without
 one. They keep people and businesses connected, they allow easy communication, they provide a source of entertainment, and they’re generally easy to use. All of these things
 are what makes cell phones so useful and necessary for modern life. But, can they be harmful? This seems to be the age-old question. Do cell phones in fact have negative
 effects on the people that use them? It is argued that cell phones, especially for the younger population, do actually affect things such as mental health, social well-being,
 self image, and more.
The very first cell phone was released almost 40 years ago in 1983, serving the basic function of making phone calls to others. Since then, cell phones have changed quite a bit. They are now smaller and much more compact, making them able to fit inside a pocket and be taken anywhere. They are able to do much more than just phone calls, they can
 send text messages, run apps, search the internet, and play games all in one space. They are also much more available to the public with widespread production and a cheaper
 price on certain models. With this increased functionality however comes some problems. Problems that can be much more dangerous than people think. Anyone with a phone can call anybody that also has one. This can lead to things like privacy and safety issues if someone were to get ahold of your number. There is also the possibility of data leaks and hacks that can spread your private information across the entire internet. Then there are the controversies surrounding social media and messaging services that can be
 potentially dangerous to young kids and teens for a multitude of reasons. These consist of online stalking, harassment and bullying, dangerous threats to their safety, and even more. Most people tend to blow these issues off, thinking that it will never happen to them, but what they don’t realize is that they happen a lot more frequently than they think. There are so many stories
 and news articles about kids and teens going missing and finding out they went off with some stranger and ended up having something terrible happen to them. The widespread use
 of cell phones makes it easier for all kinds of predators to find basically whatever they want about that person. These are some of the negative effects the use of cell phones
 can possibly have on people, especially the younger generations. 
	The worst thing about this problem is that it is nearly impossible to completely stop these crimes from happening. But, software developers are getting better and better
 everyday at protecting the data and information that is stored on their websites. Leading to less peoples safety being in jeopardy. Among this is the more focus put into these
 situations by the authorities and developers when they occur.
	   While it may be impossible to completely erase the possible threats that the use of cell phones and the things on them can cause. We know that things are get better
 everyday as the technology gets better,  and the recognition of these issues increases. We can all agree that cell phones are one of the most important technologies developed
 into the 21st century. They allow communication from very far distances, connect people and society in a way that has never been done before, and provide important information
 and useful things to us during our daily lives. But we have to be aware and cautious of the issues and dangers that do arise more often than people think. The more attention
 these issues receive the less likely they are to occur.
